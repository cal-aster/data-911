description: This dataset captures all Cincinnati Police Department Calls for Service.
  The City of Cincinnati's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system records police incident
  response activity, which includes all calls for service to emergency operators,
  911, alarms, police radio and non-emergency calls. CAD records all dispatch information,
  which is used by dispatchers, field supervisors, and on-scene officers to determine
  the priority, severity, and response needs surrounding the incident. Once an officer
  responds to a call, he/she updates the disposition to reflect findings on-scene.
  This dataset includes both proactive and reactive police incident data.

notes: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized
  and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati Open Data
  Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets (1) the last two digits of
  all addresses have been replaced with , and in cases where there is a single digit
  street address, the entire address number is replaced with X; and (2) Latitude and
  Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area
  (but not the exact location) of the incident.
