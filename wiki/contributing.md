## Open an issue

**Start opening an issue.**

Always start this way, it will give me and other collaborators a chance to provide initial feedback, thoughts and possible historical context. It can also help you find other people who may want to help you or even solutions to common problems.

When creating a issue, use the following labels:

- **bug** – A bug in our code.
- **docs** – Issues with the documentation site.
- **enhancement** – Issues requesting a feature modification or extension.
- **feature** – Issues requesting a new item.
- **help-wanted** – A person would like help with an issue.
- **meta** – Issues about the project or the GitHub repository.
- **setup** – Issues related to Luxa setup and compilation processes.

## Reporting bugs

Reporting bugs is a great way to help!

A bug is a reproducible problem within Data911 codebase or incorrect (or confusing) documentation. If you found a bug, report it using the following guidelines (adhering to these guidelines helps me to better understand the problem).

1.  **Search previous issues** — Make sure this issue hasn't already been reported.
2.  **What’s the problem?** — If the issue hasn’t been reported, explain what you are trying to do and what actually happened.
3.  **Provide an example** — A snippet that illustrates the problem is perfect.
4.  **Describe what you’ve tried so far** — Understanding what you've tried so far will help me respond more quickly. Include possible related issues that you have read or explored as well.
5.  **Label your issue as a `bug`** - This has already been said, but it is important to keep everything organized!

## Feature requests

Have an idea on how to improve Data911? There are a few ways to submit your wild ideas! Open a issue first. When opening a issue, provide the following information:

1.  Proposed feature – What are you proposing?
2.  Why do you need it? - Is this really necessary for the project? What is your timeline? Have you tried using other elements and components first?
3.  Provide examples - If you have examples of how others have solved this problem, please provide them so that I can better understand what you are asking for.
4.  Who do you want to create this? - Are you building this or do you want us to build it?
5.  Label your issue as a `feature`!

## Pull Requests

No pull request is too small or too early. The goal is to make this project move forward! Adherence to the following process is the best way to include your contribution.

1.  Make sure you have the latest changes!
2.  Checkout dev branch and create a new topic branch for your feature, change, or fix.
3.  Commit your changes in logical chunks.
4.  Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream dev branch into your topic branch.
5.  Push your branch up to your fork.
6.  [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/cal-aster/data911/pulls) with a clear title and description.

:warning: Please note that all pull requests should be merged into the dev branch. Any pull request for `staging` or `master` will be rejected.
